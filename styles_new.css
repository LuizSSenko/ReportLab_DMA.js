 * Legacy styles file - All styles have been modularized into separate CSS files:
 * - base.css: Reset, base styles, and global utilities
 * - components.css: Reusable components (buttons, cards, forms, etc.)
 * - welcome-page.css: Welcome page specific styles
 * - viewer-page.css: Viewer page layout and components
 * - map.css: Map-related styles
 * - config-modal.css: Configuration modal styles
 * - responsive.css: Responsive design styles
 * 
 * This file is kept for compatibility but can be removed once the modular structure is confirmed working.
